The Roku Culture


Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

AKT (pronounced “act”) is The Personal Performance Company that may change your life. Founded by West End stars Ed Currie and Andy Coxon, AKT is by and for those who are “Born to Perform” — on the stage, at work, or in life.

 

In 2020, The Deodorant Balm made its stunning debut to rave reviews and awards from Vogue, GQ, Esquire, and Harper’s BAZAAR. Plastic-free, aluminium-free, and gender-free, The Deodorant Balm instantly resonated with those looking for a natural deodorant that genuinely worked. Five fragrances and over 200,000 happy armpits later, The Deodorant Balm is already becoming a household name.

 

To this day, every new AKT product is put through its paces by London’s hard-working theatre community to ensure it lives up to the high standards of its founders. As a rule, AKT’s products don’t break character — ever. It’s this effectiveness that has propelled AKT from the backstage to bathroom cabinets, bedside tables, duffel bags, and carry-on luggage worldwide. And the good news is — the performance is just getting started.

Analysis & Experimentation (35%)

Scope out, structure and deliver analysis that helps the business understand what is going on, focus on the right things, and make the right decisions
Be an advocate for data measurement and AB testing. Support teams to design and implement tests so that we can be sure of the impacts of what we do, and learn as much as possible  

 

Advanced Analytics / Projects (10%)

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Data Scientist (Business Operations)

The Business Operations Team at Wolt focuses on solving country- and region-specific marketplace challenges and is tasked with growing revenue and profitability. To do this, the team works to understand the underlying drivers of growth at the market level and identifies the best opportunities to have an impact.

We take on a diverse set of challenging questions in the geospatial, logistics, and economics spaces, focused on helping balance Wolt's multi-sided marketplace across an ecosystem of courier partners, customers, and merchant partners to achieve our topline and bottomline plans. Our work sees us optimizing the experience of our customers, contributing to providing growing income opportunities for our courier partners and merchants, and driving growth, efficiency, and profitability for Wolt overall.

We work with operations teams across 30 markets globally. Our core work covers customer retention, the economic efficiency of all our markets, and geospatial analysis - but our scope frequently expands to tackle issues beyond these topics.

The role

In this role, you will work closely with the regional leadership team, partnering with our General Managers and heads of operations and marketing in multiple markets.

This isn’t a normal Data Science role. You’ll combine strong technical skills and business acumen to partner with our regional leadership team. You will be the regional expert on connecting the dots across the business to help optimize our multi-sided marketplace. You will provide recommendations and consultation on business-critical issues through rigorous analysis paired with structured, big-picture thinking.

Day-to-day activities


Running data-driven research to uncover new insights and opportunities to help drive growth in the regions and fast track our operational strategy on a daily and weekly basis.
Working with Country GMs and Heads of Marketing and Operations to size and prioritize initiatives.
Some traveling to the local markets is expected.


About You

You’re not the typical Data Scientist. You have a passion for understanding the details behind the numbers and finding opportunities that really help the business hit its goals rather than building perfect models.

You understand how to balance rigor with speed and can help your business stakeholders navigate those tradeoffs as well.


3-5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or a related quantitative role.
Ability to delve into ambiguous problems for “treasure-hunting” with data and find creative new ways to think about our business.
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team.
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem-solving.
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python.
Ability to support & influence senior leadership in making critical decisions.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. Our members rely on Netflix to entertain them, and we want to be the first place they go for that entertainment. With an audience of 600M+ and growing, we’re programming for more tastes, cultures and languages than any company has ever done before. It’s why we invest in a wide variety of TV shows and films, and work so hard to make them great.

The reach of Netflix and the fandom we create fuels the “Netflix effect” - a virtuous cycle of great content and intense fandom that catapults our stories into the cultural conversation. Netflix influences what people around the world search for and talk about, the music they listen to, the books they read, the countries they visit, and how they dress.

Our marketing efforts help to kick start the Netflix effect, and we are providing more and more ways for fans to engage with our stores: Tudum, events like Netflix Bites and Bridgerton experiences, and the launch in 2025 of the first two Netflix House locations.

Netflix is a data-driven company, and we are hiring multiple data engineers to increase our data support for marketing and fandom activities around the world. The opportunity for impact in these roles is enormous: Netflix social media channels generate more than 100B impressions a year, we are expanding fandom into the real world, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the data available to support these activities.

What have you done and what do you know?


You have 8+ years of experience and proficiency building data pipelines in both batch and real-time settings, to support a variety of use cases. Some of our data sources are small (e.g., sales at Netflix House), and some are enormous (e.g., social media feeds). Our stack is Spark, Flink, Hive/Iceberg, Kafka - experience with these specific technologies is helpful, but not strictly required.
You are proficient in Python for scripting, automation, and data orchestration frameworks, and you can write complex SQL (any variant) for ad-hoc and recurring workflows. You strive to write elegant and maintainable code, and you're comfortable picking up new technologies.
You understand how to model data efficiently for reporting and metrics, and how to organize data for scale and fast retrieval.
You have experience sourcing and modeling data from application APIs.
You’ve worked with common data warehouse solutions, such as Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Vertica, Teradata, Greenplum, etc.


What will you do?


Fully own critical pipelines and data sets to support Netflix efforts around marketing and fandom.
Directly collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, model tables using data warehouse best practices, and develop data pipelines to ensure the timely delivery of high quality data.
Creatively explore how to use data to continually add value to Netflix. Translate ambiguous business questions into clear data requirements, and then deliver on them.
Be a bridge between data engineering and the business, enabling insights that empower our colleagues to make better and more informed decisions.
Build strong partnerships with data scientists, analytics engineers, and machine Learning practitioners to enable research and insight delivery for the business.


Who are you?


You want to live and breathe the Netflix Culture. Our ways of working are different, and you are excited to embrace and contribute to our culture.
You work quickly and independently while also collaborating effectively across functions (e.g. with marketing experts, data scientists, product managers).
You thrive in a fast paced environment, and see yourself as a partner with the business with the shared goal of moving the business forward.
You have a growth mindset, and expect the same from your colleagues. Not only talented, you are also curious, authentic, selfless, determined, and industrious. You generously give and receive candid feedback, to grow yourself and those around you.
You have strong beliefs that are weakly held: you can deliberate and hear all sides of a discussion, and adapt to new perspectives that emerge from it.
You are a sharp communicator who can break down and explain complex data problems in clear and concise language.
You are comfortable getting outside of your comfort zone, to explore new tech, make your own tools, or find new creative ways to address an old problem.


Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $170,000 - $720,000.

Netflix provides comprehensive benefits including Health Plans, Mental Health support, a 401(k) Retirement Plan with employer match, Stock Option Program, Disability Programs, Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts, Family-forming benefits, and Life and Serious Injury Benefits. We also offer paid leave of absence programs. Full-time hourly employees accrue 35 days annually for paid time off to be used for vacation, holidays, and sick paid time off. Full-time salaried employees are immediately entitled to flexible time off. See more detail about our Benefits here.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Para além de uma forte componente técnica, que lhe permita implementar e manter os mais variados fluxos de dados, espera-se também um sentido crítico apurado e uma capacidade confortável de storytelling analítico, que traduza os dados em insights claros e acionáveis para a organização.

I’m working closely with this team to help the business gain a clearer understanding of the data they currently have—and how to use it effectively.




At present, there are a number of senior stakeholders eager to drive the creative side of the business forward using data. However, the wider team is not yet fully aware of the data sets available to them or how best to apply them.




As a result, they are looking for a business-focused Data Analyst who can:




Collaborate with stakeholders to understand their objectives and the problems they’re trying to solve.
Recommend the most relevant data sets to support those goals.
Build dashboards or visualisations using Power Apps or Tableau.

This is not a traditional data analyst role that involves heavy data crunching, Python coding, or ETL processes. Instead, it’s suited to someone who is commercially aware and comfortable working closely with stakeholders to shape solutions—focusing on input data selection and the creation of clear, compelling visualisations.




What They’re Looking For:




The hiring manager wants someone who knows how to ask the right questions to uncover business needs and guide stakeholders toward the right data. You’ll need:




Strong analytical thinking.
Experience in Power Apps, Power BI, or Tableau.
Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills.

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

1243,"Data Scientist, Square Support",Square,United States,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-square-support-at-square-4231969552,LinkedIn,2025-05-21,N/A,N/A,"Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

1262,Data Scientist,AE Studio,United States,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-at-ae-studio-4056144932,LinkedIn,2025-05-15,N/A,N/A,"AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).

More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.

Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please apply!

About You


Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’)
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French
Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...


BONUS POINTS FOR


Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...
Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs – extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video
JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’)
Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us...
Experience in Startups–because, y’know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one!
You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future


RECRUITING NOTE


There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio.


Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.


Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.


Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

To spearhead this transformation, we’ve established three Capability Centres. Each Capability Centre has a unique focus, playing a crucial role in developing our future transformative digital capabilities.

Through collaboration and innovation, this exceptional team will help us maintain our strategic edge over adversaries, both now and in the future.

The Capability Centres offer excellent opportunities to work with and influence senior management within DE&S and the broader Defence Enterprise, fostering new ways of working and embracing cutting-edge technologies.

Obtaining SC security clearance can be a lengthy process, and we reserve the right to withdraw any conditional offer made if the necessary security clearance isn’t obtained within 12 months.

We champion flexible ways of working. Regular in-person attendance is required to promote the benefits of face-to-face collaboration alongside flexibility of hours to support work-life balance. Initially, you may be expected to attend more frequently to familiarise yourselves with the site, the team, and your role.

Explaining technical concepts to non technical audiences.
Translating stakeholder data needs into technical requirements.

Agency: You'll be a pioneering member of the California part of the analytics team, working closely with the rest of the team based in London. Due to the distributed nature of the team, you'll have the autonomy to build relationships, drive projects and solve problems independently.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is looking for talented engineers to help build the next generation of our search infrastructure. This team is responsible for ensuring that all of the content that our users keep in Notion is available for search. You will provide the bedrock of our search and AI functionality by ensuring that our indexing systems and search clusters are comprehensive, instantaneous, and correct.

What You'll Achieve


You’ll denormalize, preprocess, and index any and every type of Notion comment that our users might find useful.
You’ll find opportunities up and down the stack to maintain Notion’s stunningly quick indexing latency.
You’ll drive us towards correctness and consistency, ensuring that every change in the application is reflected in our search indices.
You’ll scale our search infrastructure up and out, owning both the hardware and the configurations of our indices.
You’ll drive us to a best-in-class position when it comes to user privacy, security, and Enterprise-level features.
You’ll own our feature-store infrastructure, making it easy for multiple teams to make high-value information quickly and cheaply available.
You’ll work with product engineers across the organization, consulting on data modeling and ingesting new types of content.



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have experience in:
backend engineering;
data infrastructure;
search infrastructure;
queueing systems;
at-least-once message delivery;
multi-stage data pipelines; or
distributed systems
You have a track record for shipping scalable and reliable user-facing products.
You thrive when collaborating cross-functionally — especially with product, design, infrastructure or data teams.
You have a computer science background or equivalent technical experience.


Nice To Haves


You have experience building full-text search using, e.g: Lucene, Elasticsearch, Solr.
You have experience with designing, building and maintaining complex distributed systems.
You have experience with large scale data processing technologies, e.g: Spark, Flink, Kafka, Airflow, YARN/Hadoop.
You have tuned the throughput of a complex asynchronous system.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up, a SaaS company, or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would be great!)
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.
